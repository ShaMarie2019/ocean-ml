# Reviewing While loops:
# Write code to print multiples of 5 from 45 to 90
 
#i = 40
#while i <= 85:
#	i+= 5
#	print(i)
	

# With your partner: discuss: What is a set? What is it good for?
# Write your response as a comment here:
#

# Create a variable called "myset" and put whatever you want in it:

myset = "I love candy, it makes me happy."

# Create a 2D numpy array of size 3x5 with numbers 1-15:
are = np.array([(1,2,3) , (4,5,6), (7,8,9), (10,11,12), (13,14,15)])

# From your array, print the number 7:
